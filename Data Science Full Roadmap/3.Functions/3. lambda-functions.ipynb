The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with def. To understand this idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the map() function.\n\nRecall from the video that map() applies a function over an object, such as a list. Here, you can use lambda functions to define the function that map() will use to process the object. For example:\n\nnums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n\nresult = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)\nYou can see here that a lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to map() alongside a list of numbers, nums. The map object that results from the call to map() is stored in result. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with map(). For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the add_bangs() function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings.\n\n\n* In the map() call, pass a lambda function that concatenates the string '!!!' to a string item; also pass the list of strings, spells.

Here's one more function to add to your repertoire of skills.
