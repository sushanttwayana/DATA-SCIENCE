Instead, you'll want to use apply().\n\nCompare the iterrows() version with the apply() version to get the same result in the brics DataFrame:\n\nfor lab, row in brics.iterrows() :\n\n    brics.loc[lab, \"name_length\"] = len(row[\"country\"])\n\nbrics[\"name_length\"] = brics[\"country\"].apply(len)\n\nWe can do a similar thing to call the upper() method on every name in the country column. However, upper() is a method, so we'll need a slightly different approach:\n\n\n* Replace the for loop with a one-liner that uses .apply(str.upper). The call should give the same result: a column COUNTRY should be added to cars, containing an uppercase version of the country names.\n* As usual, print out cars to see the fruits of your hard labor","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n\n# Use .apply(str.upper)\nfor lab, row in cars.iterrows() :\n    # cars.loc[lab, \"COUNTRY\"] = row[\"country\"].upper()\n\n    cars1[\"COUNTRY\"] = cars1['country'].apply(str.upper)\n\nprint(cars1)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-09-07T04:20:05.469767Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-09-07T04:20:05.470234Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-09-07T04:20:05.482383Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-09-07T04:20:05.470193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-09-07T04:20:05.481095Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"           country  drives_right  cars_per_cap        COUNTRY\nUS   United States          True           809  UNITED STATES\nAUS      Australia         False           731      AUSTRALIA\nJPN          Japan         False           588          JAPAN\nIN           India         False            18          INDIA\nRU          Russia          True           200         RUSSIA\nMOR        Morocco          True            70        MOROCCO\nEG           Egypt          True            45          EGYPT\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
