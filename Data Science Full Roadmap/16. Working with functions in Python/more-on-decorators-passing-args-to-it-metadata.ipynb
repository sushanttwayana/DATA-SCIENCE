For instance, if you expect a function to return a numpy array, but it returns a list, you can get unexpected behavior. To ensure this is not what is causing the trouble, you decide to write a decorator, print_return_type(), that will print out the type of the variable that gets returned from every call of any function it is decorating.\n\n\n* Create a nested function, wrapper(), that will become the new decorated function.\n* mCall the function being decorated.\n* Return the new decorated function.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_return_type(func):\n  # Define wrapper(), the decorated function\n  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n    # Call the function being decorated\n    result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n    print('{}() returned type {}'.format(\n      func.__name__, type(result)\n    ))\n    return result\n  # Return the decorated function\n  return wrapper\n  \n@print_return_type\ndef foo(value):\n  return value\n  \nprint(foo(42))\nprint(foo([1, 2, 3]))\nprint(foo({'a': 42}))","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.178086Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.178574Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.193068Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.178541Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.191912Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"foo() returned type <class 'int'>\n42\nfoo() returned type <class 'list'>\n[1, 2, 3]\nfoo() returned type <class 'dict'>\n{'a': 42}\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Righteous return types!

So far, you have written two decorators that will add bold or italics tags to any function that returns a string. You notice, however, that these two decorators look very similar. Instead of writing a bunch of other similar looking decorators, you want to create one decorator, html(), that can take any pair of opening and closing tags.\n\n\n* Return the decorator and the decorated function from the correct places in the new html() decorator.\n\n* Use the html() decorator to wrap the return value of hello() in the strings <b> and </b> (the HTML tags that mean \"bold\").\n\n* Use html() to wrap the return value of goodbye() in the strings <i> and </i> (the HTML tags that mean \"italics\").\n\n* Use html() to wrap hello_goodbye() in a DIV, which is done by adding the strings <div> and </div> tags around a string.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-21T03:45:34.273814Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-21T03:45:34.274609Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-21T03:45:34.282142Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-21T03:45:34.274578Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-21T03:45:34.280990Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def bold(func):\n  @wraps(func)\n  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n    msg = func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return '<b>{}</b>'.format(msg)\n  return wrapper\ndef italics(func):\n  @wraps(func)\n  def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n    msg = func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return '<i>{}</i>'.format(msg)\n  return wrapper","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.406434Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.406782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.424928Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.406750Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-21T03:47:19.423837Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def html(open_tag, close_tag):\n  def decorator(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n      msg = func(*args, **kwargs)\n      return '{}{}{}'.format(open_tag, msg, close_tag)\n    #
