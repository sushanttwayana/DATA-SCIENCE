Your niece feels like she understands closures now. She has seen that you can modify, delete, or overwrite the values needed by the nested function, but the nested function can still access those values because they are stored safely in the function's closure. She even realized that you could run into memory issues if you wound up adding a very large array or object to the closure, and has resolved to keep her eye out for that sort of problem.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Working with Decorators in python\n\n### Using decorator syntax\nYou have written a decorator called print_args that prints out all of the arguments and their values any time a function that it is decorating gets called.\n\n\n* Decorate my_function() with the print_args() decorator by redefining the my_function variable.\n\n* Decorate my_function() with the print_args() decorator using decorator syntax.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def print_args(func):\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Arguments were:\", args, kwargs)\n        return func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n\ndef my_function(a, b, c):\n    print(a + b + c)\n\n# Decorate manually\nmy_function = print_args(my_function)\n\nmy_function(1, 2, 3)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-20T04:35:01.104889Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-20T04:35:01.105488Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-20T04:35:01.110792Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-20T04:35:01.105454Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-20T04:35:01.109866Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Arguments were: (1, 2, 3) {}\n6\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":29},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Decorate my_function() with the print_args() decorator\n@print_args\ndef my_function(a, b, c):\n  print(a + b + c)\n\nmy_function(1, 2, 3)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-20T04:35:03.927273Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-20T04:35:03.927595Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-20T04:35:03.932795Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-20T04:35:03.927572Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-20T04:35:03.931733Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Arguments were: (1, 2, 3) {}\n6\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that @print_args before the definition of my_function is exactly equivalent to my_function = print_args(my_function).
