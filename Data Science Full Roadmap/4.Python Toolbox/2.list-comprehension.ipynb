At this point, you have a good grasp of the basic syntax of list comprehensions. Let's push your code-writing skills a little further. In this exercise, you will be writing a list comprehension within another list comprehension, or nested list comprehensions. It sounds a little tricky, but you can do it!\n\nLet's step aside for a while from strings. One of the ways in which lists can be used are in representing multi-dimension objects such as matrices. Matrices can be represented as a list of lists in Python. For example a 5 x 5 matrix with values 0 to 4 in each row can be written as:\n\nmatrix = [ \n           [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n\n          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n          \n          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n          \n          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],\n          \n          [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]]\n          \nYour task is to recreate this matrix by using nested listed comprehensions. Recall that you can create one of the rows of the matrix with a single list comprehension. To create the list of lists, you simply have to supply the list comprehension as the output expression of the overall list comprehension:\n\n[[output expression] for iterator variable in iterable]\n\nNote that here, the output expression is itself a list comprehension.\n\n\n* In the inner list comprehension - that is, the output expression of the nested list comprehension - create a list of values from 0 to 4 using range(). Use col as the iterator variable.\n* In the iterable part of your nested list comprehension, use range() to count 5 rows - that is, create a list of values from 0 to 4.
